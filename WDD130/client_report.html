    <h2>Client Report</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</li>
            <p>I wanted to learn more about Minecraft speedrunning so I asked gemini to create a tutorial based on the videos I used to teach myself. The images on the home page are just the logo for the widely used stronghold calculator and just an ender eye. For the images on the subpages I took screenshots from my game while I was following my tutorial.</p>
            <li>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</li>
            <p>My developer and me mostly talked over email but we both had each other's phone numbers. I had no issues with communicating with my lead dev.</p>
            <li>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</li>
            <p>Almost. My site plan had some boxes around the home page images and I think it would have looked better if he followed that but I do like his header.</p>
            <li>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</li>
            <p>I would make a more detailed site plan and care significantly more about how every part looked.</p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</li>
            <p>I emailed my 2 jr devs with the site plan as soon as I got it from my client but my client provied a very poor site plan so only one of my jr devs even had any work to do.</p>
            <li>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</li>
            <p>I emailed him and he responded with a site plan but after those first emails he never responded to another email so I never got a better site plan.</p>
            <li>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</li>
            <p>I hosted the site on GitHub pages and shared the link with him in an email.</p>
            <li>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</li>
            <p>GitHub is really good for managing sites and it worked well with me and the one jr dev who made the one sub site that existed in the site plan.</p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</li>
            <p>One of my team leads responed great through email. The other one is also the person who I was the lead dev for and never gave me a site plan or responded to any quesetions.</p>
            <li>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</li>
            <p>I had no site plan for one page but the other page I had a site plan and believe I do an ok job on the About Us page.</p>
            <li>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</li>
            <p>Only the second site because of the same thing I have been complaining about the whole time.</p>
            <li>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</li>
            <p>I think my team lead deleted my css file once but other than that it all worked great.</p>

    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</li>
            <p>This project was very simple because it was mostly following a design but getting the same guy who wouldn't respond as both my client and one of my team leads made this very frustrating.</p>
            <li>What did you enjoy most about this project?</li>
            <p>I liked learning how to make a simple slideshow for the About sub page.</p>
            <li>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</li>
            <p>I would hope I could pick me team members.</p>
            <li>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</li>
            <p>I feel about the same because I had already used GitHub on my own, in high school, and in 2 of my other classes.</p>
